    <h1> <i>Led Zeppelin History</i></h1>
   
    <p>
        In 1966, London-based session guitarist <b>Jimmy Page</b> joined 
        the blues-influenced rock band the <strong>Yardbirds</strong> to replace bassist
         Paul Samwell-Smith. Page soon switched from bass to lead guitar, 
         creating a dual lead guitar line-up with Jeff Beck. Following Beck's
          departure in October 1966, the Yardbirds, tired from constant touring 
          and recording, began to wind down.<sup>[1]</sup> Page wanted to form a supergroup 
          with Beck and him on guitars, and the Who's Keith Moon and John 
          Entwistle on drums and bass, respectively.<sup>[2]</sup> Vocalists Steve Winwood
           and Steve Marriott were also considered for the project.
           <sup>[3]</sup> The group never formed, although Page, Beck, and Moon did 
           record a song together in 1966, "Beck's Bolero", in a session
            that also included bassist-keyboardist John Paul Jones <sup>[4]</sup>

        The Yardbirds played their final gig in July 1968 at <del>Luton College of 
        Technology</del> in Bedfordshire.<sub><small>[5]</small></sub> They were still committed to several 
        concerts in Scandinavia, so drummer Jim McCarty and vocalist Keith Relf
         authorised Page and bassist Chris Dreja to use the Yardbirds' name
          to fulfill the band's obligations. Page and Dreja began putting a 
          new line-up together. Page's first choice for the lead singer was 
          Terry Reid, but Reid declined the offer and suggested <u><b>Robert Plant</b></u>, 
          a singer for the Band of Joy and Hobbstweedle.<sub><small>[6]</small></sub> Plant eventually 
          accepted the position, recommending former Band of Joy drummer <u>John
            Bonham</u>.<sub><small>[7]</small></sub> John Paul Jones enquired about the vacant position of 
           bass guitarist, at the suggestion of his wife, after Dreja dropped 
           out of the project to become a photographer.<sub><small>[8]</small></sub>[nb 1] Page had known
            Jones since they were both session musicians, and agreed to let him
             join as the final member.
