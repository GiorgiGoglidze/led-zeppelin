      <div><h2> Robert Plant</h2>
    <p>Robert Anthony Plant CBE (born 20 August 1948) is 
        an English singer and songwriter, best known as the
         lead singer and lyricist of the English rock band 
         Led Zeppelin for all of its existence from 1968 up 
         until 1980, when the band broke up following the death 
         of John Bonham, the band's drummer.Plant enjoyed great 
         success with Led Zeppelin from the late 1960s to the end 
         of the 1970s. He developed a compelling image as the 
         charismatic rock-and-roll front man, similar to those 
         of contemporaries such as Mick Jagger of the Rolling 
         Stones, Roger Daltrey of the Who, Jim Morrison of the 
         Doors, and Freddie Mercury of Queen.[2] With his mane of 
         long blonde curly hair and powerful, bare-chested appearance,
          Plant helped to create the "god of rock and roll" or 
          "rock god" archetype. Although Led Zeppelin dissolved in
           1980, Plant has occasionally collaborated with Jimmy 
           Page on various projects in later years, including 
           Page and Plant, and the short-lived supergroup The 
           Honeydrippers (with Jeff Beck).</p>

   <div> <h2>Jimmy Page</h2>
   <p>James Patrick Page OBE (born 9 January 1944)[1][2] is an English 
       musician, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and record producer
        who achieved international success as the guitarist and founder 
        of the English rock band Led Zeppelin.Page is prolific in creating 
        guitar riffs and his varied style involves various alternative 
        guitar tunings, technical, and melodic solos coupled with 
        aggressive, distorted guitar tones as well as his folk and 
        eastern-influenced acoustic work. He is also noted for occasionally
         playing his guitar with a cello bow to create a droning sound 
         texture to the music.[3][4][5]Page began his career as a studio 
         session musician in London and, by the mid-1960s, alongside Big 
         Jim Sullivan, was one of the most sought-after session guitarists 
         in Britain. He was a member of the Yardbirds from 1966 to 1968.
          When the Yardbirds broke up, he founded Led Zeppelin, which was 
          active from 1968 to 1980. Following the death of Led Zeppelin 
          drummer John Bonham, he participated in a number of musical 
          groups throughout the 1980s and 1990s, more specifically XYZ, 
          the Firm, the Honeydrippers, Coverdaleâ€“Page, and Page and Plant. 
          Since 2000, Page has participated in various guest performances 
          with many artists, both live and in studio recordings, and 
          participated in a one-off Led Zeppelin reunion in 2007 that was
           released as the 2012 concert film Celebration Day. Along with 
           the Edge and Jack White, he participated in the 2008 documentary 
           It Might Get Loud.</p></div>
